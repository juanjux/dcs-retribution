"""The pilots who have asked for a rest, and your answer.

Shown once at the end of a turn, after the debriefing, when anybody asked. A pilot asks
more often the worse he is holding up, but a contented one asks now and then too. Saying
yes costs you the man for the turns you grant; saying no costs him morale.

Clicking a row picks a man out, and the rest of the list colours itself by what they
make of him -- because leave is worth more taken in company, and the point of seeing it
here is to send friends off together rather than one at a time.
