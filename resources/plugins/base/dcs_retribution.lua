-- Scenery objectives: resolve a map-object death to the building it belongs to.
--
-- A building objective is a named map object (a factory, a barracks, a fuel
-- tank) that the campaign marks with a trigger zone. DCS reports its death like
-- any other, except that getName() on a scenery object returns the object's
-- numeric id, not a name -- so the id landed in dead_events and the debriefing,
-- which resolves scenery by trigger-zone name, discarded every one of them.
-- Measured over one mission: 978 scenery deaths, 15 of them direct hits on named
-- objectives, and not a single objective recorded as damaged.
--
-- The MapObjectIsDead trigger that was supposed to catch this cannot: it is true
-- only when EVERY map object inside the zone is dead, and those polygons hold
-- scenery that cannot be destroyed at all (WOODPILE_01 and friends report a life
-- of 1e38). So the objective survives its own destruction, indefinitely.
--
-- Instead we match the death to the nearest objective by position. The radius is
-- measured, not guessed: in that mission, hits that destroyed the objective
-- itself landed 0-25 m from the zone, while collateral scenery died from 26 m
-- out. 30 m keeps the former and rejects the latter. Buildings sitting closer
-- together than that (the ZEVS transformers are 9 m apart) can take each other's
