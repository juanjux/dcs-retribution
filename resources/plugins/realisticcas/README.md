# Realistic CAS — experimental campaign plugin

The plugin is now selectable, **experimental and OFF by default**. No saved
campaign/faction settings are automatically changed. The contact core, observer
model and DCS bridge passed in-engine controls31–37; combat trials40–43 validated
gradual search with the limitations recorded in the results notes.

Campaign injection and final-pydcs environment export now have automated coverage,
including saving/reloading a MIZ and compiling its scripts. This is NOT yet a
full generated-campaign DCS acceptance or campaign-scale performance measurement.
TIC/CTLD/MOOSE ownership adapters and replacement JTACs remain pending.

### Enabling this first integration

- Select **Realistic CAS (experimental)** in Mission Plugins. Initial options:
  search20s, contact lifetime600s, approximate theater cover, debug off.
- Disable **TIC, CTLD and Moose Autolase**. Generation rejects these combinations
  explicitly; CTLD also creates dynamic units, not only JTACs. Merely disabling
  its autolase option does not provide the missing dynamic-unit adapter.
- Generated legacy JTACs are omitted while Realistic CAS is enabled, as agreed
  for this first version. This does not change `faction.has_jtac` or remove
  frontline metadata. Turning the plugin off restores the original generator path.
- Fixed map SAM groups remain known, frontline SAMs participate in fog. No F10,
  ROE, CAS weapon accuracy, flight-route or ammo changes.
- Terrain profile0 selects an explicit approximate biome by theater;1..5 override
  it (desert, grassland, tundra, forest, city). This is currently homogeneous,
  not a real per-position cover map. Unknown theaters require a manual profile.
- Uses final generated date/time, campaign reference latitude/longitude/timezone,
  three daily solar schedules (including midnight and polar handling), final
  visibility, fog/dust and cloud metadata. Native automatic fog density is unknown;
  uniform manual fog, polar brightness and cloud slabs are declared approximations.
  Preset descriptions select a cloud approximation; reused `PresetNN` names and
  zero numeric density/thickness do not mean a clear sky. Warnings are logged.
- This snapshot does not claim support for other scripts that create units or
  control visibility. Declared late starts work; arbitrary runtime clones need
  adapters. JTAC integration was deliberately deferred, not silently validated.

## Contract

- Effective visibility unit: a DCS ground GROUP. Revealing one member exposes its
  whole group. Native per-unit SetInvisible affected the whole group in engine tests.
- Blue/red symmetric, neutral groups excluded. Own-side observations cannot reveal
  a target to the opponent. `fire` automatically reveals to the opposing coalition.
- SHOT plus SHOOTING_START, not per-projectile gun sampling. Repeated fire renews the
  exposure but does not repeatedly change native visibility.
- Default TTL 600 seconds, renewed by a genuine observe/fire call. Reading or copying
  a contact never renews it. Snapshot positions do not track the hidden live object.
- Expired positions remain in private contact memory until unregister; callers see
  `revealed=false`. DCS sees live positions only while physically revealed.
- One indexed expiry-heap entry per exposed group: O(log N) renewal, bounded expiry
  work per tick, no unbounded timer allocation per shot. At most `expiryBudget`
  expirations are processed each interval; logical visibility expires immediately,
  physical concealment may lag under backlog. Measure/tune this in campaign tests.
- Explicit visibility ownership: targets require `originalInvisible=false`.
  The adapter cannot query original invisibility from DCS; the caller/generator
  must certify it. Never list TIC helpers or protected groups. No scan of all groups.
- Expiry visibility errors are logged and retried on a bounded timer. Initial
  registration/reveal failures return failure and require a new registration/event
  or observation; shutdown restoration failures require another `stop()` call.
  A failed hide is NOT reported as confirmed
  concealment: diagnostics/contact expose `backendVisible`. Acceptance of setCommand
  is the strongest API acknowledgement, not a DCS getter of physical invisibility.
- No F10 changes, task replacement, destruction/respawn, immortality or radar changes.

## Standalone mission usage (after loading both Lua files)

```lua
local fog = RealisticCAS.start({
    enabled = true, -- absent/false is inert
    ttl = 60,       -- short only for prototype tests; campaign default is 600
    debug = true,
    targets = {
        { name = "RED_ARMOUR", originalInvisible = false },
        { name = "BLUE_ARMOUR", originalInvisible = false },
    },
})
-- An approved observation supplies the observed point; do NOT poll hidden objects
-- here and call that a sensor. Attach the perception pipeline described below.
fog:observe("RED_ARMOUR", coalition.side.BLUE, observedPoint, "test observation")
-- Stops handler/scheduler and restores original visibility; retry if false.
fog:stop()
```

Allowlisted late births register on BIRTH; a new group incarnation with the same
name replaces its old registration without touching unrelated IDs. This is not
yet a TIC clone adapter. Unregistered/dead-group lifecycle pruning beyond explicit
unregister/replacement is left to the forthcoming generator/lifecycle integration.

Revealing a group is not a guarantee that a terminated AttackUnit task restarts.
In engine CAS resumed about three minutes after re-exposure in the tested profile;
direct-task resumption still needs an adapter-specific test.

Tests use Lua 5.1 via lupa, independent of the campaign Python import graph. They
validate state and DCS wiring with doubles, not the actual DCS sensor/AI simulation.

```text
python -B -m unittest discover -s tools/realistic_cas_tests -p test_contact_core.py -v
```

`tools/realistic_cas_tests/build_core_smoke.py` builds one 480-second AI-only mission
using these exact source files. It records real firing events, native detection and
core state, then restores visibility. Manual observations in that scenario are
test injections, not implemented sensors. See its generated `LEEME.md`.

## Observer pipeline

Load `core.lua`, `dcs.lua`, `sensors.lua`, `environment.lua`, `detection.lua`, then
`detectors-dcs.lua`. Attach to an active `fog` with `RealisticCAS.startDetection`:

```lua
local conditions = RealisticCAS.newEnvironment({
    defaultCover = "desert", -- explicit theatre metadata, NOT land.getSurfaceType
    startTime = 12 * 3600,   -- local mission start time, not script attachment time
    sunrise = 6 * 3600, sunset = 18 * 3600, -- example; export correct date/place
    weather = 1, visibility = 30000, -- normalized weather factor, metres visibility
    zones = {{x = 1000, z = 2000, radius = 500, cover = "city"}},
    -- Optional approximate MSL cloud slab. IR attenuation is NOT a universal veto.
    clouds = {base = 2000, top = 4000, visualTransmission = 0.05, irTransmission = 0.5},
})
local detection = RealisticCAS.startDetection(fog, {
    targets = {{name = "RED_ARMOUR-1", groupName = "RED_ARMOUR"}},
    observers = {{name = "HORNET-1", typeName = "FA-18C_hornet", category = "air",
                  role = "CAS", equipment = {targetingPod = true}}},
    environment = conditions,
    targetBudget = 64, workBudget = 128, interval = 1, revisit = 5,
    debug = false,
})
```

Declare **every member** of target groups; any observed member reveals the group.
Observers can be `air` or `ground`. The bridge resolves live units by name, rejects
dead/neutral units and type changes, and skips aircraft on the ground. Human slots
are excluded unless that observer explicitly has `allowPlayer=true`.

The small curated capability table is augmented by explicit `equipment` booleans:
`ir`, `eo`, `rbm`, `gmti`, `targetingPod`. Unknown types get visual detection only.
Do not interpret arbitrary radar/IRST presence as ground radar/FLIR. The registry
exporter reads exact per-aircraft pod CLSIDs and injects them with the registry.
The campaign bridge does **not** infer a mounted pod from an aircraft name.
The Hornet/A-10 tests showed why native getSensors alone cannot provide that fact.

Starting ranges (metres; adjustable model constants, not hardware specifications):

| Channel | Air | Ground |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Visual | 9260 | 3000 |
| EO | 12000 | 4000 |
| IR | 12000 | 4500 |
| RBM / GMTI | 12000 / 24000 | None |

Only declared capabilities enable their channel. Visual/EO use light, cover,
weather, visibility and cloud transmission; IR uses its separate attenuation and
is useful at night. Airborne visual height cap is 3500m AGL, optics 6500m AGL.
These are tunable initial approximations. Radar requires CAS/BAI/Armed Recon and
the native getRadar on flag, within a 120-degree horizontal forward cone and at
most 80-degree depression. This approximates search, **not actual radar mode or
pod direction**. GMTI requires >=2m/s target ground speed and >=1m/s radial speed.
AWACS/EWR receive no ground-radar power just because they have an air-search radar.

Terrain LOS is checked last and blocks every channel. Cover is a 250m grid with a
bounded 4096-cell cache over at most 128 configured circular zones. Illumination
uses exported sunrise/sunset with twilight ramps, cached for 30s. Clouds are a
simple slab intersection. Campaign dates and final weather are exported, with
explicit approximation warnings; detailed spatial cover and native cloud layers
remain unavailable in this first integration.

Spatial indexing is incrementally refreshed. Each tick uses at most `targetBudget`
index reads plus `workBudget` search steps (including empty cells/candidates), and
at most two observer reads. Candidates are re-read before reveal, so stale index
positions never grant a contact at an old geometry. Index/search latency can delay
discovery, especially with dense cells, moving targets or many observers. Work is
bounded, **not a guarantee of constant detection latency or measured DCS FPS**.
Search is deterministic with a revisit period, not a per-frame probability roll.
No native isTargetDetected query is required to discover an invisible target.

### Gradual search

`startDetection` accepts `acquisitionSeconds`: zero preserves the instantaneous
sensor-isolation probes; a positive value enables searching before a NEW group
is revealed. The campaign integration must explicitly select a nonzero value
(20s is the current test value, not a validated gameplay default).

Each observer examines at most one unknown group at a time, using one bounded
record per observer rather than an observer × target history. A group containing
many vehicles can contribute only one sample per sweep. Progress is capped to a
revisit interval per sample; long scheduler gaps do not count as eyes-on time.
Missing an observation sweep or losing the observer resets acquisition. Shared
contacts bypass new acquisition, but renewing them still requires a fresh valid
sensor/LOS observation. Fire reveals immediately through the existing event path.

The maximum observation gap defaults to max(60s, twice the revisit interval).
This tolerates ordinary scheduler rotation with many observers without granting
the whole gap as search time. Only at most one revisit interval is credited per
sample. A longer gap still resets search; it does not reveal anything for free.

The matched combat harness 38 completed without script errors, but is **not a
balance acceptance**: its packed ground geometry and blue-side orbit were poor
proxies for campaign CAS. Replacement 39 uses the campaign's per-role spawn-depth
bands, a 24km lateral segment, and a plain central FLOT START/END route followed
by egress. CAS is not an OrbitAction in the campaign generator. Both use native
EngageTargetsInZone; version 39 uses the campaign's default 10NM zone. See the
combat results note for casualties, repeated runs, and attribution limitations.

This limits discovery, not shooting accuracy, ammunition or number of kills.
It has automated coverage including the DCS bridge and subsequent in-engine
combat trials40–43. The earlier31–37 passes used instantaneous acquisition and
must not be cited as proof of gradual search. The isolated combat test series is
closed; it does not establish a fixed casualty-reduction percentage. In43 an A-10
crashed in ON, which confounds that pair's casualty comparison. Further calibration
belongs in campaign-scale validation, not another fixed-target kill-ratio test.

Declared lists are bounded snapshots for now: dead units stop contributing, late
births with declared names can appear, but dynamic clone enumeration/removal is
not yet implemented. Logs prefix `REALISTIC_CAS_SENSOR`; contact transitions retain
`REALISTIC_CAS`. `detection:getDiagnostics()` reports work/LOS/reveals/errors and
rejected sensor envelopes. Stopping detection leaves existing contacts to expire;
stopping the fog owner restores visibility and terminates detection on its next tick.

Run all tests with `python -B -m unittest discover -s tools/realistic_cas_tests -p "test_*.py" -v`.

Before opening or updating a PR, also run the repository-wide CI lint commands:

```text
python -m black --check .
python -m mypy game
python -m mypy tests
```

Use the versions used by CI (Black26.3.1 and mypy1.15.0 at the time of this
integration). Black checks the diagnostic builders too, not only runtime code.
Passing the Lua/functional tests is not a substitute for these checks. Resolve
typing errors in the code rather than weakening the repository's mypy rules.

## Exported mission entry point

Load the filenames in Python `SCRIPT_ORDER`, then call
`RealisticCAS.startMission(config)` with `enabled=true`, schema-1 `registry`, an
explicit `environment`, and positive `acquisitionSeconds`. Merely loading
`bootstrap.lua` does nothing. Disabled startup creates no handlers, timers or
visibility changes. The Python `render_startup` helper preserves booleans/numbers
and displays a visible error if startup fails.

The bootstrap checks that known fixed SAM objectives never appear in the managed
ground list, validates the environment before hiding groups, and rolls back
visibility if sensor startup fails. `RealisticCAS.mission:stop()` and the native
mission-end event stop detectors and restore visibility. A failed restoration
keeps the recovery handle for a later retry; it is not silently reported as success.
Lua integration tests cover these paths using DCS doubles, not native engine
acceptance. The experimental campaign hook explicitly restricts unsupported
JTAC/TIC/CTLD combinations; it is not the complete planned feature.
In-engine controls 35–37 additionally passed night/IR, controlled cloud
transmission, and RBM/GMTI with live DCS radar-on/target velocities. These validate
the model/bridge, not native radar-mode telemetry or physical cloud calibration.
See `docs/dev/design/realistic-cas-*-results-20260909.md` for exact evidence.

## Campaign registry boundary

`game/missiongenerator/realisticcasluadata.py` collects final pydcs group/unit
names, real blue/red coalition, per-unit payload CLSIDs and roles from FlightData
or explicit JTAC records. Mixed-flight human slots do not become AI observers;
AI wingmen do. Unknown/unmapped aircraft are warned about rather than assigned an
invented role. Integrated sensor capabilities remain in the Lua profile table.

`enabled=False` returns before reading mission data. Collection and typed Lua
serialization do not mutate the mission or activate scripts. Explicitly excluded
groups and ground groups with waypoint visibility commands remain outside its
ownership. Arbitrary script/trigger visibility ownership still needs integration;
this inspection is not a certificate of universal compatibility. TIC campaigns
are rejected at this boundary until the clone/visibility adapter exists.

`LuaGenerator.generate` now preflights the registry/environment/options and injects
the seven source files in `SCRIPT_ORDER`, then the typed startup action. Missing
source files fail generation before partial plugin injection. Off returns before
reading mission metadata. No new standalone mission is needed just to validate
this Python serialization boundary. Replacement JTACs and coordinated ownership
remain follow-up work under the explicitly restricted experimental option.

Confirmed scope: map SAM objectives (`SamGroundObject`, category `aa`) are never
concealed, including their generated support groups. UnitMap campaign membership
identifies them; neither vehicle type nor group name does. A SA-13 on the frontline
remains subject to fog. Buildings are not collected at all. BAI assignments grant
no automatic initial reveal; their native routes/tasks stay unchanged. The
collector requires UnitMap when enabled, so missing ownership metadata cannot
silently hide a known SAM site. Exempt sites may still provide ground observations.

## Campaign scheduling and limits

Ground combat is intentionally subject to the same fog. Both sides can start
hidden: scripted ground observers use geometry, environment and terrain LOS,
not native AI detection of invisible targets, to reveal each other. Only the
opposing coalition may reveal a managed group; there is no third-side visibility
contract. Fixed SAM objectives remain exempt.

At 0.25-second intervals the campaign scheduler shares a budget of 1,024 work
steps, 64 observer slots and **64 terrain LOS calls** across all observers. Each
observer gets at most 128 work steps before yielding; unfinished scans resume
round-robin. Budgets are not multiplied by observer count. The LOS ceiling is
256 calls per simulated second, not a measured CPU-time guarantee. Native DCS
cost and campaign frame-time impact still require in-engine measurement.

A 25-km coalition occupancy grid conservatively rejects observers with no indexed
enemy in their maximum-range bounding box before fine-cell/sensor/LOS work. The
coarse checks count against the same work budget. Target movement/coalition and
removal update occupancy during the bounded index refresh; culled observers retry
after the normal revisit delay. This can delay discovery until the index refresh
and revisit, but is not permanent culling or an assertion that a target is visible.

The acquisition gap limit remains 60 seconds: stalls do not earn continuous
observation credit. Overdue scans/gap resets emit rate-limited warnings even with
debug off. Debug counters include maximum sweep gap, overdue visits, budget hits
and culling. Overloaded missions can still suffer delayed detection; warnings
are not automatic load shedding or a guarantee for arbitrarily dense missions.

CI runs `pytest --cov --cov-report=xml tests tools/realistic_cas_tests`, including
Lua 5.1 regressions for 729 independently acquiring observers, dense-observer
fairness, per-tick limits, culling re-entry and two hidden opposing ground groups.
These use engine doubles, not a native weapon/CPU simulation. Take Off shows an
actionable warning for incompatible plugins before planning or simulation starts;
non-UI generation retains the same preflight guard.
