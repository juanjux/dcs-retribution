"""Unit tests for the debriefing kept in the save.

A Debriefing is built from the mission's state file and its unit map and holds the
flights and theater objects of a mission that is over. The window built from it was the
only place the report lived, so closing Retribution lost it. The report here is the same
thing as plain data: small enough to ride in the save, and carrying nothing that belongs
to the finished mission -- including the live game, which is hung on it for the window
and dropped again on the way out.
