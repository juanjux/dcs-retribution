"""A squadron with aircraft on hand but none free must SAY so.

The payload omits zeros to stay small, which is right for a squadron with an empty
ramp and wrong for one holding a jet that is already tasked: the planner then reads
`owned: 1` with no availability field beside it, assumes the jet is free, and refuses
its own plan when the engine disagrees ("needs 1 aircraft but the most any candidate
squadron has free is 0"). Reported by the LLM planner as an air_wing/planner
inconsistency; the numbers were never inconsistent, the zero was just invisible.
