"""Units leave their base when a transport turns up, not when the order is written.

A transfer waiting for a lift it does not have used to debit its origin anyway. The
units were then in limbo: absent from the books, so the ground war was resolved without
them, while the mission still put them on the map. They stay at the origin now until
something can actually carry them.
