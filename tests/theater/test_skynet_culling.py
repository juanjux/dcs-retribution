"""Unit tests for the Skynet IADS radius.

Skynet is handed every SAM site, EWR, comms tower and power station on the map, for
both coalitions, and its cost grows with what it manages. The radius hands it only what
is near the fighting.

Two things need guarding, and both are about absence meaning the wrong thing.

What is left out is *not* removed from the mission -- that is perf_culling's job, a
different setting -- so a flight that strays off the planned route still meets it. But
Retribution generates ground SAMs at alarm state green when perf_red_alert_state is off,
on the assumption that Skynet will wake them; a site nobody is going to wake has to come
up red instead, or the radius would quietly disarm the map.

And the radius must never touch the infrastructure. Skynet reads an absent dependency as
a working one: genericCheckOneObjectIsAlive starts at `#objects == 0`, and
isCommandCenterUsable returns true on an empty list. Dropping a bombed power station
would switch its SAMs back on, and dropping the last command centre would hand a
coalition its command back.
