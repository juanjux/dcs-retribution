"""Ship-launched cruise missile raids: eligibility, magazines, reconciliation.

Warships with land-attack cruise missiles (the Burke's Tomahawks, the CurrentHill
Kalibr hulls) can strike shore targets through a DCS ``FireAtPoint`` task with the
cruise-missile weapon flag, but nothing in Retribution ever tasked them. This is the
campaign half of the feature; the ``cruisemissiles`` Lua plugin is the in-mission half.

* **Eligibility** — :data:`LACM_SHIP_DCS_IDS`, a hand-curated set of DCS ship types.
  Neither DCS nor pydcs exposes a per-ship weapon taxonomy we could derive it from,
  so the alternative would be tasking hulls that carry no such missile at all.
* **Magazines** — DCS silently reloads every ship every mission, so without campaign
  bookkeeping each turn would hand out a free full salvo. Each launching *group*
  therefore carries a missile stock persisted on the Game
  (``cruise_missile_magazines``, keyed by the stable ``TheaterGroup.group_name``).
  There is no rearm and no resupply: the magazine is the whole war's stock.
* **Auto raids** — :func:`plan_cruise_raids` commits at most one raid per side per
  turn, against the highest-value reachable enemy ground object.

Only :func:`reconcile_cruise_missiles` — which runs at the turn boundary from what
the plugin reported actually leaving the tubes — ever writes a magazine. Everything
else is a pure read, so re-generating a mission (which players do freely) can never
charge for the same salvo twice. A group that has never fired has no stored entry at
all and reads its stock from the hulls still afloat, which is why sinking a launcher
takes its missiles with it.

The missiles are real DCS weapons fired by a real, tracked ship, so kills are recorded
through the ordinary debrief path, point defense gets to intercept them, and sinking
the shooter ends the raids. Symmetric: red Kalibr hulls raid blue exactly the same way.

Gated by ``cruise_missile_strikes`` (the magazines and the plugin's F10 call-for-fire)
and ``cruise_missile_auto_raids`` (the planner), both off by default.
