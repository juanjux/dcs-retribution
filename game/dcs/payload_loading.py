"""Resilient drop-in for pydcs' ``FlyingType.load_payloads``.

pydcs parses every payload ``.lua`` that belongs to an aircraft type and aborts
the *whole* type if any single file fails to parse: it only tolerates
``SyntaxError`` per file, so a malformed number (``ValueError: could not convert
string to float: ''``) or any other error propagates and the aircraft ends up
with no selectable payloads at all.

Third-party mods routinely ship hand-written payload files that use Lua locals,
block comments and variable references (e.g. ``["num"] = WTL`` instead of
``["num"] = 1``), which pydcs' minimal Lua reader cannot parse. One such file
then hides every other payload for that airframe -- including the user's own
payloads saved by the DCS Mission Editor, which parse fine.

This installs a replacement that parses each file independently and keeps every
payload it can read, skipping (and logging) only the files that fail. Behaviour
is otherwise identical to pydcs, including the decreasing-preference ordering of
the payload directories.
