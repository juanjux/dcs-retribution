"""The Cadet AI skill, which DCS has and pydcs does not.

The mission editor offers five skills for aircraft -- Cadet, Rookie, Trained, Veteran
and Ace -- and writes them into the .miz as ``Cadet``, ``Average``, ``Good``, ``High``
and ``Excellent`` (see ``MissionEditor/modules/me_crutches.lua``, where the display
names and the ids are two parallel lists). pydcs' ``Skill`` enum starts at ``Average``,
so the bottom rung had no way of reaching a mission file.

A unit serialises its skill as ``self.skill.value``, so a member carrying the literal
string is the whole of what the engine needs. ``Cadet`` appears in no script outside the
editor, so whether the AI actually flies differently at that setting is a question for a
test flight, not for the files.
