"""Read DTOs for the OPFOR-AI feature.

Pure functions over a ``Game`` (no ``GameContext``, no Qt) so they are unit-testable
and importable without PySide6. ``service.py`` wires these to the live game.

Token economy: these payloads go to the LLM **every turn**, so they are frugal —
numbers are rounded,
coordinates are bare ``[lat, lng]`` pairs, TOT is ``HH:MM``, and "boring" fields
(zero counts, empty strings) are left ``None`` so the transport drops them with
``exclude_none``. Convention, stated once in ``/howtoplay``: an absent numeric field
means 0. The one-time docs (start/howtoplay) are exempt — only per-turn data is.
