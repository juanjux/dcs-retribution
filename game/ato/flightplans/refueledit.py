"""Re-deciding the refuelling waypoint after the player has edited a flight.

The planner decides this once, while it builds the plan, from the plan it is building.
That is the right moment for a flight nobody touches, but it is the only moment: take
the drop tanks off, or take the route down to eight thousand feet, and nothing asks the
question again. The flight is short of fuel and the plan still says it is fine.

So the flight editor asks again on the way out, the same way it already asks whether the
ingress point should move when the stand-off weapons changed. The measure is
:func:`estimate_fuel`, which walks the route the flight actually has rather than the one
the planner would have built, so it sees the edits.

Nothing here changes a plan on its own -- it reports a verdict, and the dialog asks.
