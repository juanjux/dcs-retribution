"""Archive every generated mission so the flown ``.miz`` is never lost.

Retribution generates each turn to one fixed path -- ``retribution_nextturn.miz``,
the name the wiki, the bug-report template and every dedicated-server workflow
tell you to load -- so each **Take off** silently overwrites the mission that was
just flown. That is fine for flying and lossy for everything after it: a bug found in a
flown mission is routinely diagnosed from that mission alongside its debrief log,
and by then the next turn has already overwritten it.

The fixed output is left exactly as it is -- nothing downstream moves, because
nothing downstream ever depended on the name (DCS writes ``state.json`` to a fixed
path, and the debrief poll decides "is this result mine?" by comparing mtime
against ``miz_generated_at``, never by filename). Each generated mission is
*additionally* copied to
``Missions/Retribution Archive/<campaign>_turn<NN>_<stamp>.miz``.

Two properties this module is built around:

* **It never breaks Take off.** Archiving is best-effort: every failure is logged
  and swallowed. A full disk must not cost the user the mission they just
  generated -- by the time we run, it is already written and flyable.
* **It only ever prunes its own output.** Retention is scoped to files matching
  :data:`_ARCHIVED_MISSION` inside the archive directory, so a hand-named miz that
  ends up in there is never deleted.

There is no ``Settings`` toggle: the archive is a bounded ring buffer in an
obvious folder, and a toggle you can forget to switch on defeats the one thing it
is for -- the copy has to already exist by the time you want it.
