"""What Skynet will do with each site, worked out before the mission runs.

The state a site ends up in -- part of the network, on its own, or switched off -- is
decided inside DCS and never comes back out. It is not guesswork, though: Skynet reaches
it from things Retribution already knows, so the same answer can be reached here.

The rules below are lifted from the plugin, function by function:

* ``goLive`` refuses outright unless ``hasWorkingPowerSource()``, so a site with no
  power is dark whatever else is true of it.
* ``genericCheckOneObjectIsAlive`` starts at ``#objects == 0``, so a site with no power
  or comms dependency at all counts as having both. That is why a battery with its own
  generator is left without a power dependency rather than given a dead one.
* ``setToCorrectAutonomousState`` keeps a SAM in the network only while its own comms
  are up, the coalition still has a usable command centre, and at least one parent radar
  that covers it is itself alive, powered and connected.
* ``buildRadarCoverage`` makes that parent relationship by range: an early-warning radar
  is the parent of every SAM inside its detection range.

What cannot be known from here is written down rather than guessed at: ammunition, HARM
silence, and anything that happens once the mission is running. This is the state the
site will be in when the mission starts.
