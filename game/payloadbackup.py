"""Snapshots of the user's DCS payload library.

The custom loadouts a player builds -- in the Mission Editor or in Retribution's own
payload editor -- live as one ``.lua`` per airframe under
``Saved Games/DCS/MissionEditor/UnitPayloads``. Two things make that directory worth
protecting:

* it sits inside ``MissionEditor``, the folder people are routinely told to delete when
  the Mission Editor misbehaves. Everything else in there is a setting or a cache that
  DCS regenerates on the next launch, so the advice circulates without a warning
  attached;
* nothing else holds a copy. The loadouts are not in the campaign save, not in the
  generated ``.miz``, and DCS keeps no backup of its own. A library built over years is
  gone the moment that folder is.

So take a snapshot on startup, before anything can write to the directory, and keep the
last few.
