"""What a pilot thinks of the man next to him.

Friendship runs 0 to 10 and starts at 5: morale's shape on a shorter ruler. It is
**directional** -- what A feels about B is not what B feels about A -- which is not
decoration. The two effects that read it read opposite ends: a pilot flies better with
men *he* likes, and is pulled out of a wreck by men who like *him*.

It moves two ways. Slowly, every turn, with everyone at his base: the squadron he sees
daily warms faster than the squadron across the ramp. And in the air, where a shared
sortie is worth more than a month of drift -- which is deliberate, because the bands
that pay for anything are the ones the drift alone cannot reach.

The numbers below are defaults. Each carries the settings key that overrides it, exactly
as :mod:`game.squadrons.morale` does, so a campaign can be re-weighed without editing
code.
