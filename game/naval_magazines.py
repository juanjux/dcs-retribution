"""Cross-turn naval magazines — the fleet's anti-ship missiles are finite.

Three facts combine into one bad outcome, flown on Marianas 2027 (374 weapon
launches, essentially all inside the opening five minutes):

1. ``TgoGenerator.set_ship_engagement`` spawns every ship weapon-free with a RED
   alarm state, because ship weapons in DCS are OPTION-driven (an
   ``EngageTargets`` task is air-only and crashed the naval AI when tried). So a
   ship shoots the instant anything enters range.
2. Modern anti-ship missiles out-range the theatre (the YJ-18 reaches ~540 km
   against a 205 km Guam–Saipan gap), so "in range" is permanently true from
   t=0 and the whole fleet salvos at once rather than fighting a developing
   battle.
3. A DCS mission is a fresh spawn: loadouts reset every turn, so a fleet
   re-dumps a full magazine *every turn*. Sinking hulls was the only way volume
   ever went down — the naval war had no ammunition dimension at all.

Two independently-gated tiers answer that, mirroring  proven shape:

* **N1, staggered release** (``naval_weapon_release_stagger``) — ships generate
  ``ReturnFire`` instead of ``WeaponFree`` and the plugin releases each group to
  weapons-free at its own moment inside a window. ``ReturnFire`` rather than
  ``WeaponHold`` deliberately: a holding fleet is a defenceless one, and the
  point is to delay *initiation*, not to disarm anybody. Runtime only, no
  persisted state.
* **N2, the magazine** (``naval_magazines``) — each naval group carries a
  persisted anti-ship missile stock (:data:`ASHM_MAGAZINE_BY_TYPE`, summed over
  the group's alive hulls at first sight), emitted as this mission's hard cap.
  The plugin counts real ``S_EVENT_SHOT`` releases of anti-ship weapons and
  drops a spent group back to ``ReturnFire`` — winchester, not disarmed. What
  actually fired is mirrored into the ``naval_magazines_state`` debrief channel
  and debited at the turn boundary; **generation never debits**, so
  re-generating a mission is free.

**No double count with .** The land-attack cruise missiles  meters
(Tomahawk, the 3M14 Kalibr) are absent from :data:`ASHM_WEAPON_PATTERNS` by
construction — the two magazines meter disjoint weapon sets, so a  raid
never spends anti-ship stock and vice versa. Keep it that way when extending
the pattern list: never add a land-attack family here.

Keyed by :attr:`TheaterGroup.group_name`, the same stable
``"<id> | <name>"`` string  magazines use — the ``TheaterGroup`` lives in
the campaign save, so the key survives regeneration.

Symmetric: blue's Burkes are bound by exactly the same rule as red's Type 055s.
