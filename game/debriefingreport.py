"""The debriefing as data that outlives the mission it came from.

A `Debriefing` is assembled from the mission's state file and its unit map, and it holds
references to the flights, control points and theater objects of a mission that is over.
It was never stored anywhere: the window built from it was the only place that report
lived, so closing Retribution lost it, and there was nothing to reopen.

This is the same report reduced to what the window actually reads -- counts, names and
the pilot records, all of them plain -- which is small enough to ride in the save and
carries nothing belonging to the finished mission. The row building lives here rather
than in the window because it is arithmetic over that data, and because both the fresh
report and a restored one have to come out the same.
