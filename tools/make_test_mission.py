"""Build a stripped-down .miz with Retribution own mission generator, for testing.

A campaign mission carries ~750 groups, none of which has anything to do with
whatever you are testing, and that is what makes time acceleration crawl. This
stands up a real game from a campaign, throws away every ground object but the
target, every front line, the plugin Lua and the parked aircraft, and leaves one
package against a target at least MIN_RANGE_NM from its home field. About forty
groups, ~600 KB.

The flights are air started and the package TOT is the earliest the package can
manage, so everything is flying a minute or two after the mission starts instead of
after half an hour of ramp time.

To test something else, edit the knobs below: CAMPAIGN and the two factions,
MIN_RANGE_NM, and ELEMENTS -- one line per flight, as
(aircraft, FlightType, count, tot_offset_minutes). A negative offset asks that flight
to arrive ahead of the package. Squadrons the campaign air wing does not have are
stood up on the spot, and a flight whose aircraft cannot fly the task fails loudly at
generation (the F-15C has no SEAD task in DCS, for instance).

Run it from the repo root with the venv that builds the game:
