# 05 — Context, Memory & Persistence

This feature runs against the **live** game (`GameContext.require()`), so there is
**no headless bootstrap and no save-file loading** in the request path. Saves
matter only as the durable home for the AI's memory. This doc covers where the
non-obvious state lives and how the "intel" reads are sourced.

## `stored_context` — the AI scratchpad

A freeform store the AI owns (multi-turn strategy, lessons learned this campaign,
notes about the player). Requirement: it must survive **across turns**, **across
sessions**, and **across different AIs** — i.e. it belongs to *this campaign*.

- **Decided (juanjux): store it in the save.** Add a new field on the `Game` (e.g.
  `game.ai_stored_context: dict | str`). Because the whole `Game` is pickled on
  save (`game/persistency.py:428`), it travels with the campaign automatically and
  is there on reload — including across different AIs/sessions.
- Read/write via the service layer (`GET/PUT/POST /stored_context`,
  [`04`](04-api-reference.md)).
- Keep it small and structured (a dict of named notes, or a capped markdown blob)
  so it doesn't bloat saves or the LLM context window.
- **Save-compat:** adding a *persisted* field to `Game` interacts with the fork's
  save-compat machinery. Use a single new attribute with a safe default and
  backfill it in `Migrator` (`game/migrator.py:28`) / `Game.__setstate__`
  (`game/game.py:170`) so old saves load.

## Two memory scopes — campaign vs. cross-campaign

There are **two** places the AI keeps notes, and it must use the right one:

| Scope | Lives in | For |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **This campaign** | `stored_context` (in the save) | multi-turn strategy, lessons, observations *about this campaign* — gone when a new campaign starts (new save = empty `stored_context`) |
| **Across campaigns** | **the LLM's own persistent memory** — `MEMORY.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, or the client's memory feature — **not** the save | durable knowledge, above all **how this human plays** (habits, favourite tactics, what they fall for, recurring mistakes) so it carries into *future* campaigns |

Why the split: `stored_context` is pickled **inside the campaign save**, so it is by
definition scoped to that campaign — a fresh campaign has none. Knowledge that
should outlive a campaign (player profiling, general doctrine that worked) therefore
belongs in the **agent's own persistent memory**, which is outside the save and
outside this feature's control. The `/howtoplay` briefing tells the LLM this so it
routes each note to the right place: *campaign-specific → `stored_context`;
durable/about-the-player → my `MEMORY.md`*.

> The MCP/REST API only owns `stored_context`; it has **no endpoint** for the
> cross-campaign memory — that's the LLM client's own file/feature (e.g. Claude
> Code's `MEMORY.md`). Keep it that way: the game shouldn't try to manage the agent's
> long-term memory.

## `human_notes` — player-authored rules

Freeform text the human types in a box in the Settings window ("play aggressively",
"don't attack the carrier", house rules). Surfaced to the LLM via `GET
/human_notes`.

- Store on `Settings` (`game/settings/settings.py:93`) as a string option, or
  alongside `stored_context` in the `Game`. `Settings` is part of the pickled
  `Game`, so it persists with the campaign.
- Read-only to the AI; only the human edits it (in the UI).

## AI intel level — reuse the real visibility setting, don't invent one

`turn_context` always returns full **OPFOR (red)** detail. How much **OWNFOR
(blue)** detail it returns must come from the **existing** Retribution setting, not
a made-up flag:

- **`Settings.map_coalition_visibility`** (`game/settings/settings.py:170`), type
  **`Views`**, with options (its label → enum):
  `All → Views.All`, **`Fog of war → Views.Allies`**, `Allies only →
  Views.OnlyAllies`, `Own aircraft only → Views.MyAircraft`, `Map only →
  Views.OnlyMap`. Per the changelog this is the **DCS F10 in-mission map mode**
  (applied via the forced-options generator) — i.e. it's *the player's* view setting.

Because that setting is player-centric, the OPFOR-AI design has two sane options
(pick one; the recommendation is the first):

1. **Mirror it for fairness (recommended).** Tie the AI's blue-intel level to
   `map_coalition_visibility`: if the player chose **"Fog of war"** (`Views.Allies`)
   or stricter, the red AI is likewise limited to **what red can detect**; if
   **"All"**, the AI gets the full blue picture. This makes the AI play under
   comparable fog to the human — no new setting, and it reads naturally ("the AI
   sees what the map mode implies").
2. **Dedicated AI-intel setting** that *defaults* to deriving from
   `map_coalition_visibility`, for players who want to decouple AI difficulty from
   their own map mode. Only add this if option 1 proves too coarse.

**"What red can detect"** must be sourced from Retribution's existing detection
model — red's threat/detection zones and IADS/EWR coverage
(`game.threat_zone_for`, the IADS network) plus what the **debrief** revealed (what
blue actually flew last mission) — **not** by handing over blue's raw state. Build
this filter in `game/agent/views.py`.

> Note: don't confuse this with `Settings.use_auto_fog` (`settings.py:1420`) /
> `game/weather/fog.py`, which is *weather* fog and irrelevant here.

## `prev_turns` — the after-action history

`GET /prev_turns?n=K` returns, per prior turn: units lost (and **how / who killed
them**), bases captured/lost, and notable events. Sources:

- **Debrief / combat results.** `game/debriefing.py` parses DCS mission results;
  `MissionResultsProcessor` (`game/sim/`) commits them into the `Game`, including
  **per-loss kill attribution** (this fork credits losses to a weapon/SAM/aircraft
  — the basis for "who killed it"; see the fork's "kill attribution" feature).
  Confirm the exact stored shape during implementation.
- **In-game message log.** `game.informations` (`game.message(...)`) carries
  human-readable turn events (captures, reinforcements, repairs).
- **Stats.** `game.game_stats` for aggregate per-turn numbers.

If a structured per-turn after-action record isn't already retained across turns,
add a small **append-only history** (a list of compact turn summaries on the
`Game`, written at `finish_turn`) so `prev_turns` has a stable source instead of
re-deriving from the latest debrief. This is the one piece most likely to need new
persisted state beyond `stored_context`.

## What gets persisted (summary)

| State | Lives in | Persists because |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| AI scratchpad (`stored_context`) | new `Game` field (or sidecar) | pickled with the save |
| `human_notes` | `Settings` (in `Game`) | pickled with the save |
| `map_coalition_visibility` (Views) & feature toggles | `Settings` | pickled with the save |
| per-turn after-action (for `prev_turns`) | new append-only list on `Game` (if added) | pickled with the save |
| the plan itself (packages) | `Coalition.ato` | already pickled |

## Save format (only what's relevant here)

Saves are plain `pickle` (`.retribution`), the whole `Game` graph
(`game/persistency.py:428`). There's no JSON schema and no in-file version stamp.
The only implication for this feature: **any new persisted field must load on old
saves** — give it a default and backfill in `Migrator`/`__setstate__`. No other
part of the feature touches persistence (no loading, no headless setup).
